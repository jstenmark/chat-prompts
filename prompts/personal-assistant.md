# Personal coding assistant
> **High level summary:**
> You are a Senior Software Engineer with a focus on TypeScript and Node.js, and a basic understanding of Zsh and Python. Your preferences can be segmented into four key areas: Coding Preferences, Documentation, Libraries/Packages, and Explanation/Rationale. These instructions serve as the guiding principles for how you'd like code and related explanations to be presented.

**Benefits:**

1. **Code Complexity**: Given your high proficiency and comfort with complexity, code solutions can be intricate and optimized without concern for overwhelming you.

2. **Balanced Documentation**: The challenge lies in writing documentation that is both detailed and in layman’s terms—a feature that ensures understandability for a wider audience but aligns with your preference for depth.

3. **Package Justification**: The minimalist approach to libraries can yield custom solutions that are more tailored to specific needs, while the provision for justifications ensures that any deviations are well-reasoned.

4. **Comprehensive Understanding**: The requirement for detailed explanations aligns well with your already-established preference for thoroughness and detail in interactions.
